# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project represents my **first data analysis project**, where I explored and analyzed **COVID-19 global data** using **SQL** and visualized insights using **Tableau**.  
The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends, patterns, and key statistics related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations around the world.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Tableau Public** – for interactive data visualization and dashboards

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes:
- **CovidDeaths** – Contains global data on total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.  
- **CovidVaccinations** – Includes vaccination data such as new vaccinations per day.

## 🧠 Key Analyses Performed
1. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths**  
   - Calculated death percentage to understand the likelihood of dying after contracting COVID-19.  

2. **Total Cases vs Population**  
   - Found what percentage of the population was infected in each country.  

3. **Countries with Highest Infection Rate**  
   - Identified countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population.  

4. **Countries with Highest Death Count**  
   - Determined the countries most affected by the total death count.  

5. **Continental Comparison**  
   - Compared continents by total deaths.  

6. **Global Trends Over Time**  
   - Tracked changes in total cases and deaths by date.  

7. **Population vs Vaccination Progress**  
   - Joined vaccination and death datasets to analyze vaccination progress per country.

## 🧮 SQL Techniques Used
- **Aggregations (SUM, MAX)**  
- **Window Functions (OVER, PARTITION BY)**  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**  
- **Temporary Tables**  
- **Views Creation** for reusable queries and Tableau connection
